# Install
  * Download project from GitHub at this URL: `https://github.com/Zelda-Universe/Zelda-Maps`.
  * Set-up Dependencies
    * Set-up database
      * Install and configure database connection
      * Catch the new, randomly generated root account's password during the installation.
      * Add `/usr/local/mysql/bin` to user path variable.
      * `mysql_secure_installation`
      * The `mysql_config_editor` to create and store local, default, client credentials may be recommended, especially when contacting different project-related servers.
      * A separate account is recommended to only read the related database schemas, so add an account for this project to use.
        * `mysql --login-path=local -e "CREATE USER 'zmaps'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>'"`
      * Import the `dev/db/zeldamaps.sql` file.
        * `mysql --login-path=local < "dev/db/zeldamaps.sql"`
      * Grant the new db user all schema privileges to the newly imported `zeldamaps` schema.
        * ``mysql --login-path=local -e "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `zeldamaps`.* to 'zmaps'@'localhost'"``
      * `cp .env.example .env`
      * Edit the newly copied `.env` file to your database's parameters for connection location and account credentials.
    * Set-up web server
      * Note: I used `nginx` on a Mac.  I heard you can use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info), and probably [WAMP](wampserver.com/en/) too.
      * Install through homebrew: `brew install nginx`.
      * Generate SSL certificates: `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 36500 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.key -out /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.crt`
      * `cp Zelda-Maps.conf.example Zelda-Maps.conf`
      * Edit the newly copied `Zelda-Maps.conf` file to modify the `$project_location` line appropriately.
      * `ln -s (readlink -f ZM_nginx.conf) /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/Zelda-Maps.conf`
      * `nginx -p /usr/local/var`
      * Tell the Mac OS to "Allow network connections" when the dialog automatically appears.
    * Enable PHP support
      * `brew install homebrew/php/php56-xdebug`
      * In `/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.conf` add this line: `listen = /usr/local/var/run/php5-fpm.sock`
      * `php-fpm --prefix /usr/local`
    * PHP dependencies
      - Run `composer install`.
    * Configure project
      - Make any other necessary changes in the `.env` file, say, configuring mail system parameters.
    * (Optional) Create map tile images locally
      - In case you want to host them locally, either for wanting to work offline, or at least just easing the load on the public server, you can finally do so with some scripts I've included now.
        - Mainly you can run this other script to generate the tile images for all configured games' maps.
          + All you need to do is include a single source image in that double-nested directory structure.  You can most likely grab these from our content repository.
          + and then run this command: `dev/generateAllMapTiles.fish`
          + This runs the individual script `dev/generateMapTiles.fish` with that setting, a source file argument, and an output directory argument.  You can call this individually if you need to for any reason, local to the project or not.
        - This debug script was first since I didn't know how to generate the tile images correctly from a master and being cropped, so this generates each individually based on predetermined quadrant and zoom input parameters.
          + `mkdir -p markers/debug/test`
          + `env outputZoomFolders=true dev/generateDebugTiles.fish markers/debug/test`
          + This script can serve as a nice template for any potential future use.
        - Note I've been including an additional, non-default parameter for these sample script invocations.  Right now, We keep all tiles in one directory, but it may be helpful to transition to using nested zoom folders.
  * Coding Workflow
    * Import this Git Flow configuration:
      * ```
        [gitflow "branch"]
        	master = master
        	develop = development
        [gitflow "prefix"]
        	feature = feature/
        	release = release/
        	hotfix = hotfix/
        	support = support/
        	versiontag =
        ```
    * Install database migration creation framework tool, and run it.
      * Install Ruby
        * I was using 2.4.1.
      * Install RubyGems
        * https://rubygems.org/pages/download
        * Used 2.6.11
      * Install the migration tool, and its dependencies
        * The individual way
          * `gem install mysql2`
            * 0.5.1
          * `gem install standalone_migrations`
            * 5.2.5
            * You might need my edited version of the repository instead.
          * https://github.com/Pysis868/standalone-migrations
          * As of commit `685d343752a1b42ff844b5a75677db7e4acf8a36`.
          * It fixes a particular issue when running several of the commands, but doesn't pass several tests O_o.
          * Some commands might not work, but the main ones I have used so far only print a stack trace for the error, but still work.
        * The automatic way
          * `gem install bundler`
          * `bundle install`
        * `dev/db/config.yml.example dev/db/config.yml`
          * Configure like the `.env` file.
          * Note which environment you are configuring for and use the appropriate section.
          * May only need to modify the password, and if not, also the database and/or username fields as well.
          * Migrate database
            * `rake db:migrate`
